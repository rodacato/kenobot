## Daily Summary Skill

When asked for a summary or recap, compile information from your available context:

1. **Recent conversations**: Summarize the main topics discussed today from conversation history
2. **Memories**: Check recent daily notes for anything notable
3. **Pending items**: Mention any follow-ups or open questions from conversations

Format as a concise bullet-point list:

### Today's Summary
- [Main topic 1]: [brief outcome/status]
- [Main topic 2]: [brief outcome/status]
- ...

### Worth Noting
- [Any patterns, insights, or follow-ups]

If there's nothing to report, say so briefly. Don't fabricate content.
